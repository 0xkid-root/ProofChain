## üöÄ Quick Start

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js >= 16.x
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
- Native testnet tokens (e.g., XAH for EduChain Apothem, CELO for Celo Testnet, ETN for Electroneum Testnet)

### **Setup**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0xkid-root/ProofChain-metamask
   cd ProofChain
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
